# The MMXVIII Repository
This repository is a virus (malware, fakeAVs, etc) repository that stores any types of virus that I tested/reviewed in all my videos before.
I do **NOT** assume any responsibility for playing with these viruses. If you want to test them, do it on a VM or a sandbox! If you run them on any friends' PC, they cause damage to their computer and/or they may steal your credit card data/passwords!

### Introductions
Viruses aren't a toy to play with. Or maybe viruses are funny, if you know how to play with them. So in this repository I upload test viruses, malware, fakeAVs, ransomwares, rogue viruses, viewer-made viruses (even some of my favourite virus reviewers ones), etc.

### Password
There is no password for any of my viruses, so if you want to download & unzip them, you don't need that! **NAH NAH NAH!**

### Ratio
